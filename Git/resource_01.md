Wow. It has been awhile since I last updated here. Life and work has a way of pre-occupying me.

To kickstart this TIL again, I came across a list of good repositories while surfing social media. So I thought to keep them here for reference as well as to inform anyone who happens to stumble across this TIL.

1. https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning
	* It is a useful project-based learning repository with some interesting projects in there. I plan to give some of them a go. 

2. https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books
	* Looks like a useful collection of programming books. Will definitely peruse over time.
