# Today I Learned

While looking up a solution to a problem on the net, I stumbled upon various "Today I Learned" GitHub repositories. I then realized I learned a lot of small but useful things throughout the day. However, I never recorded these down and after some time, I tend to forget the details of what I learned, other than I did learn it at some point. This repository seeks to remedy and also to share what I learned in the off chance someone else might run into similar issues.

I am a bit late to the bandwagon but there is a saying "The best time to plant an apple tree was yesterday and the second best time to plant an apple tree is today."
